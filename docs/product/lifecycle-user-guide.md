## Lifecycle Guide for Artisans

This guide explains how artisans and operators use the ContractSpec lifecycle experience. It avoids technical jargon and focuses on clear, mobile-friendly steps.

---

### 1. Why Lifecycle Matters

- **Know where you stand**: We translate your current phase (Stage 0–6) into simple language and highlight three supporting axes (Product, Company, Capital).
- **Pick the next move**: Each assessment surfaces 3–5 recommended actions you can tackle this week.
- **Celebrate progress**: When you unlock a stage, you get ceremony copy, checklists, and a story you can share with your team or community.

---

### 2. Getting Started

1. Open the Lifecycle tile inside ContractSpec Studio (web or mobile).
2. Answer the onboarding questionnaire (about 8 short questions). You can pause anytime; answers auto-save.
3. Connect any available telemetry feeds (optional). If you skip this step, we only use your answers.
4. Tap **Run Assessment**. You will see:
   - Current stage (e.g., “Stage 2 · MVP & Early Traction”).
   - Confidence meter (green/yellow/red).
   - Product / Company / Capital axis indicators.

### 3. Reading the Dashboard

| Section | What it shows | How to use it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Stage Card | Current stage, guiding question, confidence | Use the guiding question to align your team (e.g., “Can we get real usage and learn fast?”). |
| Axes Strip | Product, Company, Capital status | Spot mismatches (e.g., Product Stage 3 but Company Stage 1). |
| Recommended Actions | 3–5 cards with effort + impact tags | Assign each action to a teammate. Tap to view full instructions. |
| Upcoming Milestones | Checklist of next targets | Mark items done as soon as you finish them; history persists. |
| Ceremony Feed | Stage transition stories | Share or replay when celebrating with your team. |

Everything is touch-friendly and readable on smaller screens. Buttons stay large; copy uses plain language.

### 4. Running Follow-up Assessments

- **Automatic**: ContractSpec reruns assessments weekly using your latest activity (if telemetry is connected).
- **Manual**: Hit **Run Again** whenever you complete major milestones or feel the stage has changed.
- **Compare**: Swipe left/right (mobile) or use arrow keys (desktop) to compare the last 5 assessments.

If confidence drops below 50%, the app highlights missing inputs (e.g., “Add retention numbers”).

### 5. Acting on Recommendations

Each recommended action contains:
- Short description, why it matters, expected result.
- Effort level (Low / Medium / High) and time estimate.
- “Start” button that logs the action to your lifecycle checklist (optional).

Actions stay editable—undo or mark “not relevant” to keep the dashboard tidy.

### 6. Stage Transitions & Ceremonies

- When the orchestrator detects a stage change, you see a “Stage Transition” card.
- Tap **Celebrate** to open ceremony content:
  - Storytelling copy (before/after).
  - Suggested ritual (e.g., “Record a 1-minute video for your community”).
  - Preview of upcoming focus areas.
- You can replay ceremonies anytime from the history tab.

Ceremonies are designed for low-tech users: light animations, optional audio, always skippable.

### 7. Customizing the Experience

- Feature Flags:
  - `LIFECYCLE_DETECTION_ALPHA` enables automated assessments.
  - `LIFECYCLE_ADVISOR_ALPHA` enables AI-generated advice.
  - `LIFECYCLE_MANAGED_SERVICE` connects you to ContractSpec operators for white-glove support.
- If you need custom stage definitions (e.g., different milestones), contact the lifecycle ops team. They can configure playbooks without touching your data.

### 8. FAQs

**Q: Do I need to connect analytics?**  
A: No. We can run on questionnaire responses only. Adding telemetry just increases confidence.

**Q: Can I export results?**  
A: Yes. Use the “Share summary” button to download a PDF or copy text for your docs.

**Q: What if I disagree with the stage?**  
A: You can submit feedback directly on the stage card. Operators see the note and can adjust scoring weights if needed.
