- Workspace command and agent behavior needed for planning and explanation workflows.
- Workspace skills for creating features and migrating components.
- MCP integration for Alpic documentation lookup.

## Belongs here

- Rules tied to ContractSpec mission, architecture, and repository conventions.
- General-purpose workspace guidance used by contributors in this monorepo.

## Does not belong here

- Cross-project engineering quality policies (put those in `software-best-practices`).
- ContractSpec governance and specification-process rules (put those in `contractspec-rules`).
- Tooling/server integrations unrelated to workspace context.
