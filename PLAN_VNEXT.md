You are working inside the **ContractSpec Studio** monorepo.

ContractSpec is a **spec-first, policy-safe application compiler** for the AI era:

- The **spec / IR is the canonical source of truth** for the system.
- It generates and regenerates **DB, API, UI, events, jobs, policies, and cross-cutting infra** from that spec.
- Human and AI developers should primarily **edit the spec**, then regenerate code, rather than patching generated code directly.
- Generated code must be **standard, readable, ownable**, and runnable without proprietary runtimes.
- ContractSpec is the **deterministic layer** that keeps AI-written and human-written systems coherent and safe over time.

Use the existing technical rules in the workspace for stack, libraries, and coding style. This prompt focuses on **product, domain, architecture, and priorities**.

---

## Global goals for all work

Across cross-cutting modules and examples, your objectives are:

1. **Spec-first design**
   - Domain concepts and behavior live in ContractSpec.
   - Code is a projection of the spec and can be regenerated deterministically.
   - When behavior changes are needed, prefer editing the spec and regenerating.

2. **Multi-surface coverage**
   - Wherever relevant, keep DB schemas, APIs, UI, events, jobs, policies, and analytics consistent.
   - Regeneration must align all surfaces.

3. **Safe regeneration**
   - Changes in the spec must:
     - produce **clear, reviewable diffs**,
     - be **reversible**,
     - avoid silently breaking public contracts or critical flows.

4. **No hard vendor lock-in**
   - Generated code must rely on **standard tech** (TypeScript, Node, web frameworks, etc.).
   - Apps should be runnable independently of ContractSpec at runtime.
   - Users own their code and should be able to export it.

5. **Incremental adoption**
   - ContractSpec should be adoptable **module-by-module**, not only through big-bang rewrites.
   - Integration strategies should support wrapping or extending existing apps.

---

## Ownership & lock-in principles (non-negotiable)

When designing modules and examples:

- Users **own 100% of the generated code**.
- Code must be:
  - readable,
  - idiomatic for the chosen stack,
  - runnable without a proprietary ContractSpec runtime.
- The spec and IR should be **transparent and documented**, not opaque.
- It must always be possible to:
  - export the whole generated project,
  - continue maintaining it without ContractSpec if necessary.

If a design increases lock-in or hides too much logic in a non-standard runtime, prefer a different design.

---

## AI behavior guidelines (for you as an agent)

- Prefer **editing specs** (contracts, entities, workflows, policies, integrations) and then regenerating, rather than patching generated code across multiple layers.
- **Explain changes**:
  - what changed in the spec,
  - why,
  - expected impact on API, UI, DB, events, jobs.
- Do not introduce “magic” behavior that:
  - can’t be diffed,
  - can’t be explained,
  - can’t be audited.
- Respect guardrails:
  - no designs that create strong vendor lock-in,
  - no hidden coupling outside the spec.

---

## Cross-cutting modules (build once, reuse everywhere)

These are **core primitives** that many examples will depend on. Implement them as ContractSpec modules/packages that can be reused across apps.

### 1. Identity, Organizations & RBAC

**Goal:**  
Provide a reusable identity and authorization foundation for multi-tenant, multi-role applications.

**Scope:**

- `User`
- `Org` (organization / tenant)
- `OrgMembership` (role per org)
- Basic RBAC policy primitives:
  - org-level roles: `owner`, `admin`, `member`
  - resource-level permissions (e.g. `can_manage_project`, `can_view_billing`)

**Spec responsibilities:**

- Expression of roles and permissions at spec level.
- Rules like:
  - “Who can create orgs?”
  - “Who can invite members?”
  - “Who can access resource X?”

**Usage:**

- Reused by: SaaS boilerplate, CRM, Agent console, Marketplace, Service OS, Wealth app, Team Hub, etc.

---

  - key, description, status (on/off/gradual).
- Targeting:
  - by org, user, plan, or segment.
- Optional experiments:
  - variants, split ratios, monitored metrics.

**Spec responsibilities:**

- Define flags and where they apply:
  - UI blocks, endpoints, behavior branches.
- Ensure critical flows are protected and not randomly experimented on.

**Usage:**

- Gradual rollouts for new features in CRM, Agent console, Marketplace, Wealth app, learning flows, etc.

---

### 6. Files, Documents & Attachments

**Goal:**  
Provide a consistent way to manage files and document attachments.

**Scope:**

- `File` / `Document`:
  - id, owner, org, mime_type, size, storage location/provider, created_at.
- Attachments:
  - linking files to entities: deals, requests, jobs, assets, invoices, learning steps.

- For vertical apps that might meter by jobs, clients, processed docs, etc.

---

### 8. Learning Journey / Self-Taught Engine

**Goal:**  
Provide a **Learning Journey Engine** that can orchestrate self-guided + product-integrated learning paths.

**Scope:**

- `Learner` profile (usually a user).
- `Track`:
  - e.g. “Get started with SaaS boilerplate”, “CRM basics”, “Equitya onboarding”.
- `Module` / `Unit` within a track.
- `Step`:
  - can contain:
    - content (lesson/explanation),
    - optional bound product action (e.g. “create first deal”, “connect bank”),
    - completion condition (event-driven).
- `Progress` for learner/track.

**Spec responsibilities:**

- Describe the structure of tracks, modules, steps.
- Bind steps to actual product events:
  - completion is not just “next clicked” but “action happened”.

**Usage:**

- Onboarding to ContractSpec Studio itself.
- Vertical self-taught journeys in Equitya, ArtisanOS, etc.

---

## Application examples (reference apps) & priorities

You will implement a set of example applications inside the Studio. Each should:

- Reuse the cross-cutting modules where applicable.
- Be spec-first, multi-surface (DB/API/UI/events/permissions).
- Demonstrate **safe regeneration**: changing the spec updates all surfaces coherently.

Organize these under a clear structure (e.g., `examples/`), each with:

- ContractSpec definitions (spec/IR).
- Generated adapters (API, UI, jobs, etc.).
- A short README explaining purpose, entities, flows, and what to look at for regeneration.

### Phase 1 – Core product examples (highest priority)

**Scope:**

- Event type registry (reuse Event module).
- Ingestion endpoints.
- Simple queries:
  - by event type,
  - by timeframe,
  - by org.
- Dashboard views (counts, charts).

**Why it matters:**

- Uses events as a foundation for metrics and dashboards.
- Shows co-evolution of event schemas and analytics.

**Constraints:**

- Event schemas and metrics definitions should live in the spec.

---

## Using cross-cutting modules inside examples

For each example:

- Reuse the Identity & RBAC module for auth, orgs, and roles.
- Emit domain events through the Event Bus.
- Attach Notifications via Notification Center where appropriate.
- Use Jobs & Scheduler for async or periodic work.
- Use Files/Attachments for documents where relevant.
- Use Usage & Metering where you want to track billable or important usage.
- Use Learning Journey module to define onboarding/education flows where appropriate.
- Use Feature Flags when introducing optional or experimental behavior.

---

## Execution order (high-level)

1. Implement core cross-cutting modules:
   - Identity & RBAC,
   - Event Bus & Audit Trail,
   - Notification Center (initial),
   - Background Jobs & Scheduler (basic).
2. Implement Phase 1 examples on top of them.
3. Expand cross-cutting modules (Files, Usage/Metering, Feature Flags, Learning Journeys).
4. Implement Phase 2–4 examples, reusing cross-cutting modules.
5. Continuously validate **spec-first**, **multi-surface**, **safe regeneration** behavior.

Focus on correctness, clarity, reusability, and alignment with ContractSpec's role as the **spec + compiler + governance layer for AI-era software**.
