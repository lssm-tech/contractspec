# ContractSpec Roadmap

This roadmap reflects current priorities and is updated as the community ships new capabilities. We welcome feedback through issues and RFCs.

## Now (0-3 months)

- Stabilize ContractSpec OSS onboarding and docs.
- Expand plugin API and starter templates.
- Harden CI gating and deterministic diff workflows.
- Add trust signals (security policy, dependency provenance).

## Next (3-6 months)

- Remote registry support for plugins and specs.
- Studio-managed policy workflows and audit trails.
- Integration marketplace and verified plugin catalog.
- Spec migration tooling for legacy APIs.

## Later (6-12 months)

- Multi-tenant registry orchestration.
- Advanced policy simulation and drift analytics.
- Compliance reporting exports.

## How to contribute

- Check issues labeled `good first issue`, `help wanted`, `integration`, or `docs`.
- Propose larger changes through the RFC process.
- Share implementation notes in pull requests so others can iterate.
