# Docs system overview

ContractSpec treats documentation as a first-class output of your specs. The docs system combines:

- Contract operations and schemas
- DocBlocks (goal/how/usage/reference)
- Presentations for rendering

The result is a consistent docs surface across CLI, web, and MCP.

## Key surfaces

- Generation: `docs.generate`
- Index/search: `docs.search`
- Contract reference: `docs.contract.reference`
- Publish: `docs.publish`
