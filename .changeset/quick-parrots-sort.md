Refine health transport resolution with deterministic strategy fallbacks, provider-level capability gating, and explicit unofficial-route credential checks.

Add reusable provider normalizers, split health implementations into focused modules, and support OAuth refresh-token configuration (`oauthTokenUrl`, `tokenExpiresAt`) across health provider contracts, docs, and factory tests.
