Add a full health and wearables integration stack across contracts and runtime, including provider specs for Whoop, Apple Health, Oura, Strava, Garmin, Fitbit, MyFitnessPal, Eight Sleep, Peloton, and Open Wearables.

Introduce health transport strategy resolution with official API/MCP, aggregator API/MCP, and gated unofficial fallback support, and wire provider implementations/factory routing with tests and docs updates.
