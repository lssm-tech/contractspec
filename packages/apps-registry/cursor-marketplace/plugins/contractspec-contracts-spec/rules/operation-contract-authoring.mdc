Treat operation contracts as product APIs with strict metadata quality.

- New operations use `defineCommand` or `defineQuery` before handlers.
- Require `meta.key`, `meta.version`, `description`, `goal`, `context`, `owners`, `tags`, and `stability`.
- Keep `io.input`, `io.output`, and `io.errors` explicit and typed.
- Bind handlers through registry wiring and avoid implementation-only endpoint behavior.
