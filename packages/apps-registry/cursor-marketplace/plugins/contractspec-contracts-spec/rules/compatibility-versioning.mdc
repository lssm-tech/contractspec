Every contract change must carry compatibility intent.

- Classify changes as additive, behavior-compatible, or breaking.
- Breaking changes require migration notes and version bump rationale.
- Run impact analysis against baseline before merge.
- Keep release notes tied to impacted contract keys and versions.
