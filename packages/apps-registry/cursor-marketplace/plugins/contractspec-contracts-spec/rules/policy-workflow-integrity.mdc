Keep policy and workflow declarations executable, explainable, and testable.

- Policy decisions must be explicit and explainable by runtime context.
- Workflow contracts must declare transitions, side effects, and validation boundaries.
- Do not bypass policy/workflow layers in implementation code.
- Update related tests when policy or workflow contracts change.
