description: Require typed AgentSpec definitions and bounded execution in @contractspec/lib.ai-agent

Treat agent execution as governed runtime behavior.

- Define agents with typed `AgentSpec` and explicit tool schemas.
- Keep `maxSteps` explicit and conservative.
- Ensure spec registry wiring matches runtime agent identity.
- Reject prompt-only orchestration that bypasses typed specs.
