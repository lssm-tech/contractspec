Integration code must be safe by default.

- Read credentials through approved secret providers; never hardcode secrets.
- Keep provider health checks and failure classification explicit.
- Ensure retries, idempotency, and timeouts are defined for remote calls.
- Redact sensitive metadata from logs and telemetry.
