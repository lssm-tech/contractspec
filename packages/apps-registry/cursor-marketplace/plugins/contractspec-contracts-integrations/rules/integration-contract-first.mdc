Every provider-facing change starts with integration contracts, not adapter code.

- Add or evolve integration specs before provider implementation.
- Keep capability and feature declarations aligned with exposed provider contracts.
- Declare request/response boundaries and error contracts explicitly.
- Avoid runtime behavior that bypasses integration contract definitions.
