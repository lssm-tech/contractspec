Before release, classify compatibility impact and verify guardrails end to end.

Core rules:

- Any contract change must be categorized as additive, compatible behavior change, or breaking change.
- Breaking changes require explicit migration notes and version bump rationale.
- Release reports must include impact output, validation results, and unresolved risk items.
- MCP integrations must be health-checked with successful endpoint initialization.

Required release checks:

1. `contractspec impact --baseline main --format markdown`
2. `contractspec ci --check-drift`
3. `contractspec version analyze --baseline main`
