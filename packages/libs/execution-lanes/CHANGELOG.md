## 0.1.7

### Patch Changes

- chore: auto-bump internal dependents
- Updated dependencies because of Add mobile-safe FormSpec layout helpers and scoped DataView filters.

FormSpec authors can now use `responsiveFormColumns(...)` for explicit mobile-first column metadata without changing legacy numeric `layout.columns` behavior. DataView contracts can declare `filterScope.initial` and `filterScope.locked` filters so generic list/search contracts can be reused in context-restricted screens while keeping locked constraints out of user-editable URL state.

- Updated dependencies because of Add OSS harness CLI verification with deterministic Playwright, optional agent-browser visual runs, auth profile refs, visual diff evidence, replay bundles, and core scenario success semantics.
