# @contractspec/example.integration-hub

Website: https://contractspec.io

**Integration Hub example with sync engine and field mappings for ContractSpec.**

## What This Demonstrates

- Connection management with typed schemas and enums.
- Integration lifecycle (create, configure, sync).
- Sync engine with field mapping and status tracking.
- MCP server example for tool integration.
- Capability and feature definition patterns.
- React UI with dashboard, hooks, markdown renderers, and shared ContractSpec tables for connections and sync configs.
- Contract-backed visualizations for integration mix, connection health, and sync-state comparison.
- Client-mode table capabilities including sorting, pagination, column visibility, pinning, resizing, and expanded operational details.
- Event definitions and operation test-specs.
- Managed/BYOK credential setup metadata with monorepo-aware Next and Expo env aliases.

## Running Locally

From `packages/examples/integration-hub`:
- `bun run dev`
- `bun run build`
- `bun run test`
- `bun run typecheck`

## Usage

Use `@contractspec/example.integration-hub` as a reference implementation, or import its exported surfaces into a workspace that composes ContractSpec examples and bundles.

## Architecture

- `src/connection` is part of the package's public or composition surface.
- `src/docs/` contains docblocks and documentation-facing exports.
- `src/events.ts` is package-level event definitions.
- `src/example.ts` is the runnable example entrypoint.
- `src/handlers/` contains handlers or demo adapters wired to contract surfaces.
- `src/index.ts` is the root public barrel and package entrypoint.
- `src/integration` is part of the package's public or composition surface.
- `src/setup` exposes BYOK credential manifests, secret-reference fixtures, and monorepo env aliases.

## Public Entry Points

- Export `.` resolves through `./src/index.ts`.
- Export `./connection` resolves through `./src/connection/index.ts`.
- Export `./connection/connection.enum` resolves through `./src/connection/connection.enum.ts`.
- Export `./connection/connection.operation` resolves through `./src/connection/connection.operation.ts`.
- Export `./connection/connection.presentation` resolves through `./src/connection/connection.presentation.ts`.
- Export `./connection/connection.schema` resolves through `./src/connection/connection.schema.ts`.
- Export `./docs` resolves through `./src/docs/index.ts`.
- Export `./docs/integration-hub.docblock` resolves through `./src/docs/integration-hub.docblock.ts`.
- Export `./events` resolves through `./src/events.ts`.
- Export `./example` resolves through `./src/example.ts`.
- Export `./setup` resolves through `./src/setup/index.ts`.
- Export `./setup/credential-setup` resolves through `./src/setup/credential-setup.ts`.
- The package publishes 46 total export subpaths; keep docs aligned with `package.json`.
