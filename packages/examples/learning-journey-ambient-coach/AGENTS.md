- Package visibility: published package.
- Primary consumers are example explorers, template authors, and documentation readers.
- Related packages: `@contractspec/lib.contracts-spec`, `@contractspec/module.learning-journey`, `@contractspec/tool.bun`, `@contractspec/tool.typescript`.

## Architecture

- `src/docs/` contains docblocks and documentation-facing exports.
- `src/example.ts` is the runnable example entrypoint.
- `src/index.ts` is the root public barrel and package entrypoint.

## Guardrails

- Keep the example package demonstrative, buildable, and aligned with the exported feature surface.
- Do not add hidden production assumptions that are not actually implemented in the example.
- Changes here can affect downstream packages such as `@contractspec/lib.contracts-spec`, `@contractspec/module.learning-journey`, `@contractspec/tool.bun`, `@contractspec/tool.typescript`.
