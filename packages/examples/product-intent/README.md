# @contractspec/example.product-intent

Website: https://contractspec.io

**Product intent example: evidence ingestion and prompt-ready outputs.**

## What This Demonstrates

- Canonical `product-intent` export via `ProductIntentDiscoverySpec`.
- Evidence loading and ingestion pipeline.
- PostHog signal extraction for product analytics.
- Action synchronization across tools.
- Script-based execution pattern.
- `src/docs/` contains docblocks and documentation-facing exports.

## Running Locally

From `packages/examples/product-intent`:
- `bun run dev`
- `bun run build`
- `bun run test`
- `bun run typecheck`

## Usage

Use `@contractspec/example.product-intent` as a reference implementation, or import its exported surfaces into a workspace that composes ContractSpec examples and bundles.

## Architecture

- `src/docs/` contains docblocks and documentation-facing exports.
- `src/example.ts` is the runnable example entrypoint.
- `src/index.ts` is the root public barrel and package entrypoint.
- `src/load-evidence.test.ts` is part of the package's public or composition surface.
- `src/load-evidence.ts` is part of the package's public or composition surface.
- `src/posthog-signals.ts` is part of the package's public or composition surface.
- `src/product-intent.discovery.ts` defines the exported product-intent spec.
- `src/product-intent.feature.ts` defines a feature entrypoint.

## Public Entry Points

- Export `.` resolves through `./src/index.ts`.
- Export `./docs` resolves through `./src/docs/index.ts`.
- Export `./docs/product-intent.docblock` resolves through `./src/docs/product-intent.docblock.ts`.
- Export `./example` resolves through `./src/example.ts`.
- Export `./load-evidence` resolves through `./src/load-evidence.ts`.
- Export `./posthog-signals` resolves through `./src/posthog-signals.ts`.
- Export `./product-intent.discovery` resolves through `./src/product-intent.discovery.ts`.
- Export `./product-intent.feature` resolves through `./src/product-intent.feature.ts`.
- Export `./script` resolves through `./src/script.ts`.
- Export `./sync-actions` resolves through `./src/sync-actions.ts`.
- The package publishes 9 total export subpaths; keep docs aligned with `package.json`.
