Founder: We're a tiny team. Every week we get ten different feature requests. Our loudest customers push us to build things that aren't on our roadmap.
Interviewer: How do you decide what to build?
Founder: Honestly, it's gut feeling and whoever shouts the loudest. We don't have a framework for weighing evidence. We rarely look back at the impact of past features.
Founder: For example, last quarter we added multi‑currency support because two enterprise prospects demanded it. It took a month to build. Those deals never closed. Meanwhile, our activation rate stayed flat.
Interviewer: Do you collect any data to inform decisions?
Founder: We run a survey occasionally, but it's surface level. We don't tag feedback by segment or severity. We certainly don't link it to metrics like time‑to‑value or churn.
Founder: I would love an evidence‑based system. Something that says, "Here are the top pains across your segments, here is the potential impact, here is how confident we are." Then I can decide.
Interviewer: Do you feel you chase competitors?
Founder: Yes. We see competitor features on Product Hunt and we panic. Without a clear thesis, we copy them. That's not sustainable.
Founder: I'd prefer to know our users' biggest pains and fix those. Maybe it's onboarding friction. Maybe it's reporting. I don't know because all I hear are anecdotes.
Interviewer: How would you measure success if you did adopt evidence‑based prioritisation?
Founder: Clarity. I'd like to see a roadmap tied to metrics: activation, retention, conversion. And I'd like to stop building the wrong thing. That alone would save us months.
Founder: We need to grow, but we can't hire a product team right now. If a tool can give me data‑driven recommendations and a spec, I'm listening.
