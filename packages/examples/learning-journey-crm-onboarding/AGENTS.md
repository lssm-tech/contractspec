# AI Agent Guide — `@contractspec/example.learning-journey-crm-onboarding`

Scope: `packages/examples/learning-journey-crm-onboarding/*`

Learning journey track that onboards users to the CRM pipeline example.

## Quick Context

- Layer: `example`.
- Package visibility: published package.
- Primary consumers are example explorers, template authors, and documentation readers.
- Related packages: `@contractspec/example.crm-pipeline`, `@contractspec/lib.contracts-spec`, `@contractspec/lib.schema`, `@contractspec/module.learning-journey`, `@contractspec/tool.bun`, `@contractspec/tool.typescript`.

## Architecture

- `src/docs/` contains docblocks and documentation-facing exports.
- `src/example.ts` is the runnable example entrypoint.
- `src/handlers/` contains handlers or demo adapters wired to contract surfaces.
- `src/index.ts` is the root public barrel and package entrypoint.
- `src/learning-journey-crm-onboarding.feature.ts` defines a feature entrypoint.
- `src/operations` is part of the package's public or composition surface.
- `src/presentations` is part of the package's public or composition surface.

## Public Surface

- Export `.` resolves through `./src/index.ts`.
- Export `./docs` resolves through `./src/docs/index.ts`.
- Export `./docs/crm-onboarding.docblock` resolves through `./src/docs/crm-onboarding.docblock.ts`.

## Guardrails

- Keep the example package demonstrative, buildable, and aligned with the exported feature surface.
- Do not add hidden production assumptions that are not actually implemented in the example.
- Changes here can affect downstream packages such as `@contractspec/example.crm-pipeline`, `@contractspec/lib.contracts-spec`, `@contractspec/lib.schema`, `@contractspec/module.learning-journey`, `@contractspec/tool.bun`, `@contractspec/tool.typescript`.
