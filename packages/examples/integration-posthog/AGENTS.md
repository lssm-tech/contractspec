# AI Agent Guide — `@contractspec/example.integration-posthog`

Scope: `packages/examples/integration-posthog/*`

PostHog analytics integration example: capture events, run HogQL, and manage feature flags.

## Quick Context

- Layer: `example`.
- Package visibility: published package.
- Primary consumers are example explorers, template authors, and documentation readers.
- Related packages: `@contractspec/integration.providers-impls`, `@contractspec/lib.contracts-spec`, `@contractspec/tool.bun`, `@contractspec/tool.typescript`.

## Architecture

- `src/docs/` contains docblocks and documentation-facing exports.
- `src/example.ts` is the runnable example entrypoint.
- `src/index.ts` is the root public barrel and package entrypoint.
- `src/integration-posthog.feature.ts` defines a feature entrypoint.
- `src/posthog.ts` is part of the package's public or composition surface.
- `src/run.ts` is part of the package's public or composition surface.

## Public Surface

- Export `.` resolves through `./src/index.ts`.
- Export `./docs` resolves through `./src/docs/index.ts`.
- Export `./docs/integration-posthog.docblock` resolves through `./src/docs/integration-posthog.docblock.ts`.
- Export `./example` resolves through `./src/example.ts`.
- Export `./integration-posthog.feature` resolves through `./src/integration-posthog.feature.ts`.
- Export `./posthog` resolves through `./src/posthog.ts`.
- Export `./run` resolves through `./src/run.ts`.

## Guardrails

- Keep the example package demonstrative, buildable, and aligned with the exported feature surface.
- Do not add hidden production assumptions that are not actually implemented in the example.
- Changes here can affect downstream packages such as `@contractspec/integration.providers-impls`, `@contractspec/lib.contracts-spec`, `@contractspec/tool.bun`, `@contractspec/tool.typescript`.
- Changes here can affect downstream packages such as `@contractspec/integration.providers-impls`, `@contractspec/lib.contracts-spec`, `@contractspec/tool.bun`, `@contractspec/tool.typescript`.
