# AI Agent Guide — `@contractspec/example.team-hub`

Scope: `packages/examples/team-hub/*`

Team Hub example with spaces, tasks, rituals, and announcements.

## Quick Context

- Layer: `example`.
- Package visibility: published package.
- Primary consumers are example explorers, template authors, and documentation readers.
- Related packages: `@contractspec/lib.contracts-spec`, `@contractspec/lib.schema`, `@contractspec/tool.bun`, `@contractspec/tool.typescript`.

## Architecture

- `src/announcement` is part of the package's public or composition surface.
- `src/docs/` contains docblocks and documentation-facing exports.
- `src/entities/` contains domain entities and value objects.
- `src/events.ts` is package-level event definitions.
- `src/example.ts` is the runnable example entrypoint.
- `src/handlers/` contains handlers or demo adapters wired to contract surfaces.
- `src/index.ts` is the root public barrel and package entrypoint.

## Public Surface

- Export `.` resolves through `./src/index.ts`.
- Export `./announcement` resolves through `./src/announcement/index.ts`.
- Export `./announcement/announcement.operations` resolves through `./src/announcement/announcement.operations.ts`.
- Export `./announcement/announcement.schema` resolves through `./src/announcement/announcement.schema.ts`.
- Export `./docs` resolves through `./src/docs/index.ts`.
- Export `./docs/team-hub.docblock` resolves through `./src/docs/team-hub.docblock.ts`.
- Export `./entities` resolves through `./src/entities/index.ts`.
- Export `./events` resolves through `./src/events.ts`.
- Export `./example` resolves through `./src/example.ts`.
- Export `./handlers` resolves through `./src/handlers/index.ts`.
- The package publishes 23 total export subpaths; keep docs aligned with `package.json`.

## Guardrails

- Keep the example package demonstrative, buildable, and aligned with the exported feature surface.
- Do not add hidden production assumptions that are not actually implemented in the example.
- Changes here can affect downstream packages such as `@contractspec/lib.contracts-spec`, `@contractspec/lib.schema`, `@contractspec/tool.bun`, `@contractspec/tool.typescript`.
- Changes here can affect downstream packages such as `@contractspec/lib.contracts-spec`, `@contractspec/lib.schema`, `@contractspec/tool.bun`, `@contractspec/tool.typescript`.
