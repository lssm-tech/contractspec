# AI Agent Guide — `@contractspec/example.kb-update-pipeline`

Scope: `packages/examples/kb-update-pipeline/*`

Example: KB update automation pipeline with HITL review and auditability.

## Quick Context

- Layer: `example`.
- Package visibility: published package.
- Primary consumers are example explorers, template authors, and documentation readers.
- Related packages: `@contractspec/lib.contracts-spec`, `@contractspec/lib.schema`, `@contractspec/tool.bun`, `@contractspec/tool.typescript`.

## Architecture

- `src/docs/` contains docblocks and documentation-facing exports.
- `src/entities/` contains domain entities and value objects.
- `src/events.ts` is package-level event definitions.
- `src/example.ts` is the runnable example entrypoint.
- `src/handlers/` contains handlers or demo adapters wired to contract surfaces.
- `src/index.ts` is the root public barrel and package entrypoint.
- `src/kb-update-pipeline.feature.ts` defines a feature entrypoint.

## Public Surface

- Export `.` resolves through `./src/index.ts`.
- Export `./docs` resolves through `./src/docs/index.ts`.
- Export `./docs/kb-update-pipeline.docblock` resolves through `./src/docs/kb-update-pipeline.docblock.ts`.
- Export `./entities` resolves through `./src/entities/index.ts`.
- Export `./entities/models` resolves through `./src/entities/models.ts`.
- Export `./events` resolves through `./src/events.ts`.
- Export `./example` resolves through `./src/example.ts`.
- Export `./handlers` resolves through `./src/handlers/index.ts`.
- Export `./handlers/memory.handlers` resolves through `./src/handlers/memory.handlers.ts`.
- Export `./kb-update-pipeline.feature` resolves through `./src/kb-update-pipeline.feature.ts`.
- The package publishes 14 total export subpaths; keep docs aligned with `package.json`.

## Guardrails

- Keep the example package demonstrative, buildable, and aligned with the exported feature surface.
- Do not add hidden production assumptions that are not actually implemented in the example.
- Changes here can affect downstream packages such as `@contractspec/lib.contracts-spec`, `@contractspec/lib.schema`, `@contractspec/tool.bun`, `@contractspec/tool.typescript`.
- Changes here can affect downstream packages such as `@contractspec/lib.contracts-spec`, `@contractspec/lib.schema`, `@contractspec/tool.bun`, `@contractspec/tool.typescript`.
