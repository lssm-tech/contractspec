ContractSpec — LLM Guide (web-landing)

Purpose
- ContractSpec is the deterministic, spec-first compiler that keeps AI-written software coherent, safe, and regenerable.
- This app (packages/apps/web-landing) is the public marketing + docs + Studio entry surface.

Repository structure (high-level)
- packages/apps/web-landing: Next.js App Router site (this app)
- packages/apps/api-contractspec: API server (Elysia) including MCP endpoints
- packages/libs/contracts: core ContractSpec library (SpecRegistry, specs, adapters, docs DocBlocks)
- packages/bundles/contractspec-workspace: reusable workspace services (build/validate/diff/list/sync/watch/clean/test/regenerator wrapper)

Key routes / entry points (web-landing)
- Marketing: / (and /product, /pricing, /templates, /changelog, /contact, /legal/*)
- Docs: /docs/*
- Studio entry: /studio (auth-protected), /studio/features (public)
- API routes: /api/graphql/*, /api/auth/*, /api/organizations/*

Authentication
- Uses Better Auth via `@lssm/bundle.contractspec-studio/application/services/auth`.
- Studio routes require a valid session (see auth route handlers under `src/app/api/auth/...`).

API surfaces (base paths)
- GraphQL: `/api/graphql`
- MCP (served by api-contractspec app): see `@lssm/lib.contracts/docs/tech/mcp-endpoints.docblock`

Feature flags / experiments
- Prefer centralized enums/consts for flag names and analytics props; avoid scattering.
- Look for feature flag usage in bundles and libs (not apps).

Data stores (conceptual)
- This app is mostly a UI surface. Data access is mediated via GraphQL/auth services.

Docs source of truth
- Canonical docs are DocBlocks under `packages/libs/contracts/src/docs/**` (not /docs markdown).
- LLM guide endpoint(s):
  - /llms serves this file (rewrite)
  - /llms.txt serves this file (static)
  - /llms.md and /llms.mdx alias to this file
  - llms.contractspec.lssm.tech aliases to this file

Operational notes
- No secrets in code. Env vars are required for auth + telemetry + API URLs; do not log them.
- Logging: use approved structured logging utilities; avoid console.* in server/runtime paths.
