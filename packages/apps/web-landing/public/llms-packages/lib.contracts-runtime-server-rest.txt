# @contractspec/lib.contracts-runtime-server-rest

**REST server runtime adapters for ContractSpec contracts.**

## What It Provides

- **Layer**: lib.
- **Consumers**: bundles, all REST apps.
- Related ContractSpec packages include `@contractspec/lib.contracts-spec`, `@contractspec/lib.schema`, `@contractspec/tool.bun`, `@contractspec/tool.typescript`.
- Related ContractSpec packages include `@contractspec/lib.contracts-spec`, `@contractspec/lib.schema`, `@contractspec/tool.bun`, `@contractspec/tool.typescript`.

## Installation

`npm install @contractspec/lib.contracts-runtime-server-rest`

or

`bun add @contractspec/lib.contracts-runtime-server-rest`

## Usage

Import the root entrypoint from `@contractspec/lib.contracts-runtime-server-rest`, or choose a documented subpath when you only need one part of the package surface.

## Architecture

- `src/contracts-adapter-hydration.ts` is part of the package's public or composition surface.
- `src/contracts-adapter-input.ts` is part of the package's public or composition surface.
- `src/index.ts` is the root public barrel and package entrypoint.
- `src/rest-elysia.ts` is part of the package's public or composition surface.
- `src/rest-express.ts` is part of the package's public or composition surface.
- `src/rest-generic.ts` is part of the package's public or composition surface.
- `src/rest-next-app.ts` is part of the package's public or composition surface.

## Notes

- High blast radius — all REST APIs depend on this package.
- Framework adapters (Elysia, Express, Next.js) must stay independent of each other.
- Do not introduce cross-adapter coupling.
