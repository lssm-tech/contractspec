# Welcome to ContractSpec

**ContractSpec is the deterministic, spec-first compiler that keeps AI-written software coherent, safe, and regenerable.**

## What is ContractSpec?

In 2025/2026, AI agents generate enormous amounts of code. But they have critical limitations:

- **They can't enforce invariants** — AI-generated code drifts from business rules
- **They break multi-surface consistency** — API, DB, UI, and events get out of sync
- **They hallucinate refactors** — AI "improvements" introduce subtle bugs
- **They destroy long-term maintainability** — no source of truth, no safe regeneration path

## Our Role

ContractSpec is the **safety and governance layer for AI-coded systems**:

1. **Canonical Source of Truth** — Contracts define what the system _should_ do, not just what it _does_
2. **Safe Regeneration** — Generate and regenerate code across surfaces without breaking invariants
3. **Multi-Surface Consistency** — One spec, multiple outputs, always in sync
4. **AI Governance** — Constrain what AI agents can change, enforce contracts they must respect

## Key Benefits

✅ **You keep your app** — ContractSpec works with existing codebases
✅ **You own the code** — Generated code is standard TypeScript, SQL, GraphQL
✅ **No vendor lock-in** — ContractSpec is a compiler, not a prison
✅ **Incremental adoption** — Start with one endpoint, one model, one contract

## Getting Started

This walkthrough will guide you through:

1. **Setting up your project** — Configure CLI, MCP servers, and AI rules
2. **Creating your first spec** — Use the interactive wizard
3. **Validating specs** — Ensure correctness and consistency
4. **Building from specs** — Generate implementation code
5. **Exploring specs** — Navigate visually in the sidebar
