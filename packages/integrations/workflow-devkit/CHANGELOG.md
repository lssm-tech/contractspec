## 0.1.10

### Patch Changes

- chore: auto-bump internal dependents
- Updated dependencies because of chore: auto-bump internal dependents
- Updated dependencies because of Add mobile-safe FormSpec layout helpers and scoped DataView filters.

FormSpec authors can now use `responsiveFormColumns(...)` for explicit mobile-first column metadata without changing legacy numeric `layout.columns` behavior. DataView contracts can declare `filterScope.initial` and `filterScope.locked` filters so generic list/search contracts can be reused in context-restricted screens while keeping locked constraints out of user-editable URL state.

- Updated dependencies because of Add OSS harness CLI verification with deterministic Playwright, optional agent-browser visual runs, auth profile refs, visual diff evidence, replay bundles, and core scenario success semantics.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- cce2b13: Add first-class Workflow DevKit support for `WorkflowSpec`, including new runtime metadata, stricter validation for Workflow-backed workflows, a dedicated Workflow DevKit integration package, CLI artifact generation, and Workflow-aware chat route helpers exposed from `@contractspec/module.ai-chat/core/workflow` so standard chat imports do not pull Workflow-only runtime assets into non-Workflow builds.

  Also harden supporting runtime surfaces by reusing Playwright browser instances in the harness runtime, mapping design-system button `onPress` handlers correctly to DOM clicks, and switching the workspace git adapter to argument-safe subprocess calls while tightening slow test coverage around those flows.

- Updated dependencies [cce2b13]
  - @contractspec/lib.contracts-spec@5.0.3
  - @contractspec/lib.ai-agent@8.0.3
