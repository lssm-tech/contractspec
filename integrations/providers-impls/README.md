# @contractspec/integration.providers-impls

Website: https://contractspec.io/


SDK-backed implementations of ContractSpec integration provider interfaces.

Depends on:
- `@contractspec/lib.contracts` for provider interface types and IntegrationSpec declarations
- `@contractspec/integration.runtime` for secret/guard helpers (when needed)
